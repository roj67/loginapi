# loginapi
It is a repo about simple login and signup api. <br>
In signup we use SMTP to send OTP to register the user.<br>
In login we use JWT authorization.<br>
I have used Microsoft Sql server to store the user.<br>
The code is written in c#.<br>
This api was used for a flutter app login and signup page.
